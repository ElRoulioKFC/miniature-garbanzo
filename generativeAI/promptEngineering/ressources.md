### Mindset and prompt attributes

Try to use an "ai mindset". Ask yourself about adjectives or format and thinks about them parts by parts. We need to think about limits like context lengths or token limits.


* content length

    you could use something like that: make a 500 words, but to be more precise and less blocking the prompt you could use "that i can read in 3 minutes" or "write a summary"

    You can also ask later to reduce or maximize the length.

* Types/formats

* Domain

* Perspective

* Tone

* Purpose

* Role

The more important prompt attribute. 

You can also flip the role and reverse the role to get better questions to ask the chat for.
For exemple instead of writing:
you are a senior software engineer and you help me...
you can write:
you are a junior software engineer/enthousiast and you are asking about...


#### Flipping the role

    One of the role's perks that is underestimated is the reversion of the roles.
    Ideas about asking the starting point before the true chat.
    As a product manager, how do you ensure a product is on time and loved by users ?
    As a creative director, how would you approach a global ad campaign?
    As a hiring manager, what do you look fo in a leader?
