## React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8.

**Key Hooks:**
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useContext`

For more details, refer to the [official React documentation on Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

## Context API

The Context API is a way to manage and share state across your application without passing props down manually through every level of the component tree.

**Key Concepts:**
- `React.createContext()`
- `Context.Provider`
- `Context.Consumer`

Learn more about Context API in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

## Code Splitting

Code splitting is a technique used to split your code into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand. This helps in reducing the initial load time of your application.

**Techniques:**
- Dynamic `import()`
- `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`

Explore more about code splitting in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).

## Performance Optimization

Performance optimization in React involves techniques to make your React application faster and more efficient.

**Techniques:**
- Memoization with `React.memo()`
- Virtualization
- Efficient re-rendering
